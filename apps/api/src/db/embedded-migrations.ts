// Stub. Populated at compile time by `scripts/compile.ts`, which rewrites
// this file before invoking `bun build --compile` and restores the empty
// stub afterwards. The runtime path in `db/index.ts` prefers the on-disk
// `apps/api/drizzle/` folder when present and falls back to this map only
// inside the compiled binary, where the folder has been excluded.
//
// If `bun run check` (or any Bun-direct entry point) somehow lands here
// with the stub still in place, the boot guard in `runMigrations` throws
// with a remediation hint.
